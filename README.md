# professional-portfolio

## Description
This portfolio was created to showcase my current/future projects that I will be working on. Each of these projects can be visited within the portfolio page. This website was created using html and advanced css. One of the major components that I focused on was flexbox in css. This was very helpful to its flexibility and made it easier to adjust the website according to different screen sizes. In the future I hope to add more projects to this website. I also plan to use bootstap to enhance the way the website looks and make it easier to edit/build.
